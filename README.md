  For this project, I am using a dataset from Kaggle that contains information about student habits and their impact on academic performance. The dataset includes both categorical and continuous variables, making it ideal for exploratory visualizations.
As a student who occasionally struggles with distraction and procrastination, I was personally drawn to this dataset. It offered an opportunity to explore relatable behaviors through interactive data visualizations and uncover patterns that may resonate with other students.	

  The dashboard revealed several meaningful insights into student habits and their relationship to academic performance. One of the most prominent findings was the inverse relationship between study hours and sleep duration. This trend was particularly noticeable among female students, where increased study time often correlated with reduced sleep. The scatterplot, enhanced by gender filters and a dynamically generated trendline, made this relationship easily identifiable and emphasized the trade-offs many students face when balancing academic demands with rest.

  Another key observation emerged from the line graph tracking average sleep across age groups. The data showed that older students tend to have more consistent and longer sleep durations. This may be attributed to increased experience, better time management, or a more stable lifestyle as students advance in their academic careers. The interactive zoom and brush functionality in this visualization allowed users to closely examine specific age brackets, helping them explore how sleep behaviors evolve over time.

  The revised stacked bar chart provided a clearer picture of how students allocate their time across activities such as studying, social media, watching Netflix, and exercising. By shifting the visualization to show averages instead of totals, a gender-based trend became apparent: female students, on average, devoted more time to academically productive activities than their male counterparts. The ability to isolate specific categories within the bar chart made this insight even more accessible and actionable for users.

  Finally, the boxplot comparing attendance rates between students with and without part-time jobs highlighted the variability in multitasking ability. While some students managed their work and school commitments effectively, others struggled with consistent attendance. The inclusion of interactive features such as clickable boxes for zooming into specific distributions, outlier highlighting, and detailed tooltips allowed users to explore the data in a nuanced and intuitive manner. These interactive components across all visualizations empowered users to uncover insights independently and engage more deeply with the dataset.
